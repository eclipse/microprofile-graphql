== Introduction to GraphQL

=== About GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with
existing data. GraphQL interprets strings from the client, and returns data in an understandable, predictable,
pre-defined manner.
GraphQL is an alternative, though not necessarily a replacement for REST.

GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. Facebook delivered both a
https://facebook.github.io/graphql/[specification] and a https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js[reference implementation]
 in JavaScript.

On 7 November 2018, Facebook moved the GraphQL project to the newly-established
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2018/11/intent_to_form_graphql/[GraphQL foundation], hosted by the
non-profit Linux Foundation. This is a significant milestone in terms of industry and community adoption.
GraphQL is widely used by https://graphql.org/users/[many customers].

[[why_graphql]]
=== Why GraphQL
The main reasons for using GraphQL are:

* Avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching data. Clients can retrieve several types of data in a single request or can
limit the response data based on specific criteria.
* Enabling data models to evolve. Changes to the schema can be made so as to not require changes on existing clients,
and vice versa - this can be done without a need for a new version of the application.
* Advanced developer experience:
** The schema defines how the data can be accessed and serves as the contract between the client and the server.
Development teams on both sides can work without further communication.
** Native schema introspection enables users to discover APIs and to refine the queries on the client-side. This
advantage is increased with graphical tools such as https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL] and
https://apis.guru/graphql-voyager/[GraphQL Voyager] enabling smooth and easy API discovery.
** On the client-side, the query language provides flexibility and efficiency enabling developers to adapt to the
constraints of their technical environments while reducing server round-trips.

[[graphql_and_rest]]
=== GraphQL and REST

GraphQL and REST have many similarities and are both widely used in modern microservice applications. The two
technologies also have some differences.

REST stands for "Representational State Transfer". It is an architectural style for network-based software specified
by Roy Fielding in 2000 in a https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf[dissertation]
defining 6 theoretical constraints:

. uniform interface
. stateless
. client-server
. cacheable
. layered system
. code on demand (optional).

REST is often implemented as JSON over HTTP, but REST is fundamentally technically agnostic to data type and transport;
it is an architectural style. In particular, it doesn't require to use HTTP. However, it recommends using the maximum
capacity of the underlying network protocol to apply the 6 basic principles. For instance, REST implementations can
utilize HTTP semantics with a proper use of verbs (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and response codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx).

GraphQL takes its roots from a Facebook https://facebook.github.io/graphql/[specification] published in 2015. As of
this date, GraphQL has been subject to 5 releases:

* June 2018
* October 2016
* April 2016
* October 2015
* July 2015

According to it's definition: "GraphQL is a query language for describing the capabilities and requirements of data
models for client‐server applications."

Like REST, GraphQL is independent from particular transport protocols or data models:

* it does not endorse the use of HTTP though in practice, and like REST, it is clearly the most widely used protocol,
* it is not tied to any specific database technology or storage engine and is instead backed by existing code and data.

[[what_make_graphql_different]]
=== What makes GraphQL different?
In practice, here are the main differentiating features of GraphQL compared to REST:

* *schema-driven*: a GraphQL API natively exposes a schema describing the structure of the data and operations (queries
and mutations) exposed. This schema acts as a contract between the server and its clients. In a way GraphQL provides an
explicit answer to the API discovery problem where REST relies on the ability of developers to properly use other
mechanisms such as HATEOS and/or OpenAPI,
* *single HTTP endpoint*: a typical GraphQL API is made of a single endpoint and access to data and operations is
achieved through the query language. In an HTTP context, the endpoint is defined as a URL and the query can be
transported as a query string (GET request) or in the request body (POST request),
* *flexible data retrieval*: by construction the query language enables the client to select the expected data in the
response with a fine level of granularity, thus avoiding over- or under-fetching data,
* *reduction of server requests*: the language allows the client to aggregate the expected data into a single request,
* *easier version management*: thanks to the native capabilities to create new data while deprecating old ones,
* *partial results*: partial results are delivered by the GraphQL server in case of errors. A GraphQL result is made of
data and errors. Clients are responsible for processing the partial results,
* *low coupling with HTTP*: GraphQL does not try to make the most of HTTP semantics. Queries can be made using GET or
POST requests. The HTTP result code  does not reflect the GraphQL response,
* *challenging authorization handling*: an appropriate data access authorization policy must be defined and implemented
to counter the extreme flexibility of the query language. For example, one client may be authorized to access some data
that others are not,
* *challenging API management*: most API management solutions are based on REST capabilities and allow for endpoint
(URL-based) policies to be established. GraphQL API has a single entry point. It may be necessary to analyze the client
request data to ensure it conforms to established policies. For example, it may be necessary to validate mutations or
to prevent the client from executing an overly complex request that would crash the server.

[[graphql_and_database]]
=== GraphQL and Databases

GraphQL is about data query and manipulation but it is not a database technology:

* It is a query language for APIs,
* It is database and storage agnostic,
* It can be used in front of any kind of backend, with or without a database.

One of GraphQL's strengths is its multi-datasource capability enabling a single endpoint to aggregate data from various
sources with a single API.

[[microprofile_graphql]]
=== MicroProfile GraphQL

The intent of the MicroProfile GraphQL specification is to provide a "code-first" set of APIs that will enable users to
quickly develop portable GraphQL-based applications in Java.

There are 2 main requirements for all implementations of this specification, namely:

* Generate and make the GraphQL Schema available. This is done by looking at the annotations in the users code, 
and must include all GraphQL Queries and Mutations as well as all entities as defined implicitly via the response type or argument(s) of Queries and Mutations.
* Execute GraphQL requests. This will be in the form of either a Query or a Mutation. As a minimum the specification must support executing these requests via HTTP.
