== Using the running

The running allow you to test the TCK app against a running server using https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL].

Currently you can choose between:

* https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail]
* https://www.payara.fish/software/payara-server/payara-micro/[Payara Micro]

You can run the chosen server using the correct maven profile in the runner directory:

[source,bash]
----
 mvn clean install -Pthorntail
----

or

[source,bash]
----
 mvn clean install -Ppayara-micro
----

You can then navigate to http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/]

To stop the server simply `ctrl-c` the maven process.
