= Microprofile GraphQL TCK

image:/tck/high-level.png[link="/master/tck/high-level.png"]

== Dynamic tests

Tests can be added by creating a new test group (folder) in `src/test/resources`.

The folder name will be the name of the test. You can then add the following:

*Mandatory files*

* input.graphql - the graphql query or mutation 
* output.json - the expected json result

*Optional files*

* test.properties - pass properties to the test, supported properties:
** ignore - true or false (default false), will ignore the test if set to true
** priority - the weight of the test, this will influence the order in which test are run
* variables.json - if you need to pass any variables with the request
* httpHeaders.properties - if you need to set any HTTP Headers with the request
* prepare.graphql - a graphql mutation to run before the test to prepare the test data
* cleanup.grapql - a graphql mutation to run after the test to restore the test data

== Running the tests.

The test run will load all tests in `src/test/resources` and will execute then as ordered by the 
priority property.
