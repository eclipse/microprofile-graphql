# This tests that a `currentLocation` method is invoked to determine the location from a different back end
# "database".  Because this database is expensive, we only want to look up the location if the client has
# actually requested this information.
# TODO: ideally we would test that the `currentLocation` is not invoked on other requests, but only when the
# user explicitly requests it.
